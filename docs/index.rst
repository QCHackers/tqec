TQEC
====

The TQEC (for Topological Quantum Error Correction) project aims at implementing 
the right tools to help engineers and researchers working on quantum error correction
building codes in practice and experimenting.

It is composed of two sub-projects:

1. a frontend, implemented mostly in Javascript and available at 
   `https://tqec.app/ <https://tqec.app/>`_,
2. a backend, implemented in Python.

This documentation is, for the moment, only about the backend. The frontend 
documentation might eventually be added.
