# Step-by-step coding of the frontend

Are you new to JavaScript, React and Pixi?  
Do you want to contribute or simply understand the code powering the visual frontend of `tqecjs`?  
Look no further.  

In this folder we will re-build the frontend adding a few lines of codes at a time.
The commit message will make clear which functionality is added (or, at least, the goal is to have informative commits).

**NOTE:** After merging the commits have been squashed.
One can access them at the [PR #166 page](https://github.com/QCHackers/tqec/pull/166).


**NOTE:** The step-by-step frontend does not exactly match the official one in the `<repo>/frontend` folder.
This helps to better understand certain design choices while at the same time providing a playground for alternatives.



## Installation and execution

From this folder, install by typing:
```bash
npm start
```

Run the app in the development mode by typing:
```bash
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
```bash
npm test
```
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

Build the app for production to the `build` folder:
```bash
npm run build
```
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!  
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
