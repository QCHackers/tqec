# Alternative Frontend

The alternative frontend follows a different design w.r.t. the official frontend in `<repo>/frontend`.

**NOTE:** The early development of this alternative frontend is connected to the beginner's guide
of building a project in Javascript using React and Pixi.
The step-by-step guide can still be accessed in the form of commit history from the
[PR #89 page](https://github.com/QCHackers/tqec/pull/89).

**NOTE:** The codebase has been moved out of the official tqec repository with
[PR #216](https://github.com/QCHackers/tqec/pull/216)
and to [tqec-alternative-frontend](https://github.com/QCHackers/tqec-alternative-frontend).



## Installation and execution

From this folder, install by typing:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the app in the development mode by typing:
```bash
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
```bash
npm test
```
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

Build the app for production to the `build` folder:
```bash
npm run build
```
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
