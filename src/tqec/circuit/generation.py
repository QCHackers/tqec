"""Defines :meth:`generate_circuit`, one of the core method of the :mod:`tqec`
package.

This module defines two of core methods of the :mod:`tqec` package:

- :meth:`generate_circuit` that is the most convenient method for external users.
- :meth:`generate_circuit_from_instantiation` that gives more freedom to the
  user (and is used internally by :meth:`generate_circuit`) at the expense of
  often less convenient inputs.

Both of these methods are used to generate the ``stim.Circuit`` instance
representing **one** time slice (often equivalent to "one QEC round"). Users are
expected to call these methods several times and concatenate the output
``stim.Circuit`` instances in time to obtain a full QEC implementation.

Note that these methods do not work with ``REPEAT`` instructions.

    quantum circuit from the description of the template that should be
    implemented as well as the plaquettes that should be used to instantiate the
    provided template.

    This function requires that a few pre-conditions on the inputs are met:

    1. the number of plaquettes provided should match the number of plaquettes
       required by the provided template.
    2. all the provided plaquettes should be implemented on
       :class:`~.qubit.GridQubit` instances **only**.

    If any of the above pre-conditions is not met, the inputs are considered
    invalid, in which case this function **might** raise an error.
