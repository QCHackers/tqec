    This function only performs a shallow search. Read attentively the warning and

    Warning:
        This function only performs a shallow computation! It will consider REPEAT
        constructs as an atomic fragment with outgoing stabilizers on both sides,
        but will not recurse in the loop.

        In practice, this limitation should not be a huge issue. As the loops are
        still considered as an atomic operation, resets in the last fragment of
        the loop body and measurements in the first fragment of the loop body are
        still accounted for.
        This means that if the loop body only implements a simple QEC round (e.g.,
        surface code or repetition code), or more generally if the loop body is
        considered as a single :class:`Fragment` instance, the detectors will be
