    This function encodes the SAT problem of interest into the provided `solver`.
    As such, the provided `solver` is expected to be a newly created instance,
    and will be mutated by this function.

    The encoded problem is the following:

    Find the indices of Pauli strings in `available_pauli_strings` such that
    the product of all the corresponding Pauli strings is exactly equal to
    `expected_pauli_string` on all the qubits in `qubits_to_consider`.

    The following post-condition should be checked after solving:

    ```py
    expected_pauli_string = PauliString({})      # Fill in!
    available_pauli_strings = [PauliString({})]  # Fill in!
    qubits_to_consider = frozenset()             # Fill in!
    solver = None                                # Fill in!

    encode_pauli_string_exact_cover_sat_problem_in_solver(
        solver, expected_pauli_string, available_pauli_strings, qubits_to_consider
    )
    indices = None # Solve the problem encoded in solver and recover the indices.

    final_pauli_string = pauli_product([available_pauli_strings[i] for i in indices])
    for q in qubits_to_consider:
        assert final_pauli_string[q] == expected_pauli_string[q]
    ```

    The SAT problem contains one boolean variable per Pauli string in
    `available_pauli_strings`, deciding if the associated Pauli string should
    be part of the cover.
    The formula is quite simple: for each qubit in `qubits_to_consider`, the following
    two boolean formulas should be `True`:

    1. The X part of the resulting Pauli string, obtained from XORing the X part of each
       Pauli string weighted by the boolean variable that decides if the Pauli string should
       be included or not, should be equal to the X part of the expected final Pauli string.
    2. Same reasoning, but for the Z part.

    Note that the "should be equal to the [P] part of the expected final Pauli string" is
    natively implemented in the SAT solver used, so we do not need to adapt the formula
    with some binary logic tricks. The solver really solves a conjunction of
    `a XOR b XOR ... XOR z == [True/False]`.

    This leads to a formula with `2*len(qubits_to_consider)` XOR clauses that should all
    be verified for a cover to exist.
    Each of the `2*len(qubits_to_consider)` XOR clauses can contain up to
    `len(available_pauli_strings)` XORed items, but a simplification is made that should
    reduce that number: if the Pauli string acts trivially w.r.t the considered Pauli effect
    (X or Z), the boolean variable is removed from the formula as we know for sure that
    this particular Pauli string cannot impact the result on that specific qubit and Pauli
    effect.

            `expected_pauli_string`. Qubits not listed in this input will simply be ignored

    This function encodes the SAT problem of interest into the provided `solver`.
    As such, the provided `solver` is expected to be a newly created instance,
    and will be mutated by this function.

    The encoded problem is the following:

    Find the indices of Pauli strings in `available_pauli_strings` such that
    the product of all the corresponding Pauli strings commutes with
    `expected_pauli_string` on all the qubits in `qubits_to_consider`.

    The SAT problem contains one boolean variable per Pauli string in
    `available_pauli_strings`, deciding if the associated Pauli string should
    be part of the cover.
    The formula is quite simple: for each qubit in `qubits_to_consider`, the following
    two boolean formulas should be `True`:

    1. The X part of the resulting Pauli string, obtained from XORing the X part of each
       Pauli string weighted by the boolean variable that decides if the Pauli string should
       be included or not, should be equal to the X part of the expected final Pauli string
       or be equal to I.
    2. Same reasoning, but for the Z part.

    Note that the "should be equal to the [P] part of the expected final Pauli string" is
    natively implemented in the SAT solver used, so we do not need to adapt the formula
    with some binary logic tricks. The solver really solves a conjunction of
    `a XOR b XOR ... XOR z == [True/False]`.
    Also note that the "or be equal to I" part is a little bit more tricky and requires
    some care. The logic retained for each of the possible Pauli terms is explained
    inline within the code.

    The number of XOR clauses in the formula depends on the number of each Pauli terms in
    the input `expected_pauli_string` that is considered (i.e. on qubits in
    `qubits_to_consider`). Let [P] be the number of Pauli term equal to P in
    `expected_pauli_string`, the number of XOR clauses in the resulting formula is
    `(2 * [I] + [X] + [Y] + [Z]) * len(qubits_to_consider)`. That means that there
    are less clauses in the SAT problem defined in this function than in the one defined in
    :func:`encode_pauli_string_exact_cover_sat_problem_in_solver`, except if
    `expected_pauli_string` only contains identity gates, in which case the two functions
    return the same number of XOR clauses.

    Just like :func:`encode_pauli_string_exact_cover_sat_problem_in_solver`, the number
    of terms in each XOR clause can vary depending on the provided Pauli strings in
    `available_pauli_strings`.

    Also note that the problem defined above includes a trivial solution: do not include
    any Pauli string. This lead to an identity Pauli string, that will necessarilly commute
    with the provided target. A specific clause is added to the SAT problem to avoid that
    particular trivial solution.
