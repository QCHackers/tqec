"""Defines the :class:`ScheduledCircuit` class.

This module is central to the `tqec` library because it implements one of the
most used class of the library: :class:`ScheduledCircuit`.

A :class:`ScheduledCircuit` is "simply" a `stim.Circuit` that have all its
moments (portions of computation between two `TICK` instructions) assigned to
a unique positive integer representing the time slice at which the moment should
be scheduled.

Alongside :class:`ScheduledCircuit`, this module defines:

- :class:`Schedule` that is a thin wrapper around `list[int]` to represent a
  schedule (a sorted list of non-duplicated positive integers).
- :func:`remove_duplicate_instructions` to remove some instructions appearing
  twice in a single moment (most of the time due to data qubit
  reset/measurements that are defined by each plaquette, even on qubits shared
  with other plaquettes, leading to duplicates).
- :func:`merge_scheduled_circuits` that merge several :class:`ScheduledCircuit`
  instances into one.
- :func:`relabel_circuits_qubit_indices` to prepare several
  :class:`ScheduledCircuit` before merging them. This function is called
  internally by :func:`merge_scheduled_circuits` but might be useful at other
  places and so is kept public.
