        Annotates that the qubit/detector coordinate origin is being moved.

        This is a replication of the
        [stimcirq.ShiftCoordsAnnotation](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/blob/main/glue/cirq/stimcirq/_shift_coords_annotation.py)
        class. We can directly use `stimcirq.ShiftCoordsAnnotation` here, however,
        replication brings the class into the `tqec` namespace and is useful for the
        potential future iteration.

        Since the operation is not a real quantum operation, it does not have qubits
        and is not applied to any qubits. This might cause surprising behavior if you
        try to append or insert it into a circuit. It is always recommended to containerize
        this operation in a `cirq.Moment` before appending it to a circuit.

        In `tqec`, this kind of annotation operation should be tagged with the `cirq.VirtualTag`
        and the `STIM_TAG` to work correctly with the circuit transformation and the noise model.
        You can use the `make_shift_coords` helper function to create an instance of this class
        with the correct tags. Otherwise, you might need to manually tag the operation with the
        `cirq.VirtualTag` and the `STIM_TAG`.
