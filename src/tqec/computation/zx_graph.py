        graph. And convert node by node, edge by edge. Future work may include
        automatic compilation from a simplified or a more general ZX diagram to
        a block graph implementation.

        To successfully convert a ZX graph to a block graph, the following
        necessary conditions must be satisfied:

        - The ZX graph itself is a valid representation, i.e.
          :py:meth:`~tqec.computation.zx_graph.ZXGraph.check_invariants` does
          not raise an exception.
        - Every nodes in the ZX graph connects to edges at most in two
          directions, i.e. there is no 3D corner node.
        - Y nodes in the ZX graph can only have edges in time direction.

        The conversion process is as follows:

        1. Construct cubes for all the corner nodes in the ZX graph.
        2. Construct pipes connecting ports/Y to ports/Y nodes.
        3. Greedily construct the pipes until no more pipes can be inferred.
        4. If there are still nodes left, then choose orientation for an
           arbitrary node and repeat step 3 and 4 until all nodes are handled or
           conflicts are detected.

        Args:
            zx_graph: The ZX graph to be converted to a block graph.

        Starting from each leaf node in the graph, the function explores how can the X/Z logical observable
        move through the graph to form a correlation surface:

        - For a X/Z kind leaf node, it can only support the logical observable with the opposite type. Only
        a single type of logical observable is explored from the leaf node.
        - For a Y kind leaf node, it can only support the Y logical observable, i.e. the presence of
        both X and Z logical observable. Both X and Z type logical observable are explored from the leaf node.
        And the two correlation surfaces are combined to form the Y type correlation surface.
        - For the port node, it can support any type of logical observable. Both X and Z type logical observable
        are explored from the port node.

        The function uses a flood fill like recursive algorithm to find the correlation surface in the graph.
        Firstly, we define two types of nodes in the graph:

        - *broadcast node:* A node that has seen logical observable with basis opposite to its own basis.
        A logical observable needs to be broadcasted to all the neighbors of the node.
        - *passthrough node:* A node that has seen logical observable with the same basis as its own basis.
        A logical observable needs to be only supported on an even number of edges connected to the node.

        The algorithm starts from a set of frontier nodes and greedily expands the correlation
        surface until no more broadcast nodes are in the frontier. Then it explore the
        passthrough nodes, and select even number of edges to be included in the surface. If
        no such selection can be made, the search is pruned. For different choices, the algorithm
        recursively explores the next frontier until the search is completed. Finally, the branches
        at different nodes are produced to form the correlation surface.

        Returns:
            A list of `CorrelationSurface` in the graph.
