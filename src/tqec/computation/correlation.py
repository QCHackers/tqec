    """A correlation surface in the logical computation.

    The correlation surface specifies the correlation between the logical operators in the
    spacetime diagram. Logical observable can be derived from the boundaries of the correlation
    surface.

    The correlation surface is defined by the set of edges in the ZX graph. Each edge represents
    a X/Z surface within the pipe in the `BlockGraph` picture. A Y surface is represented by two
    distinct edges, one for the X surface and one for the Z surface. Therefore, the nodes of the
    edges in the correlation surface must be Z/X type nodes.


    Attributes:
        nodes: A set of `ZXNode` representing the nodes in the correlation surface. The kind of
            the node is determined by what kinds of correlation the node supports. If both X and
            Z correlation are supported, the node is a Y type node.
        span: A set of `ZXEdge` representing the correlation between logical operators spanning
            in the 3D space. The edges in the span must be between Z/X type nodes.
        external_stabilizer: A mapping from the port label to the Pauli operator at the port, which
            represents the spacetime stabilizer for the correlation surface. Sign of the stabilizer
            is neglected.
