class CorrelationSurface:
    """A correlation surface in a computation is a set of measurements whose
    values determine the parity of the logical operators at the inputs and
    outputs associated with the surface.

    Here we represent the correlation surface in terms of the ZX graph. The insight is that the spiders
    pose parity constraints on the operators supported on the incident edges. The flow of the logical
    operators through the ZX graph, respecting the parity constraints, forms the correlation between the
    inputs and outputs. However, the sign of measurement outcomes is neglected in this representation.
    And we need to recover the measurements when instantiating an explicit logical observable from the
    correlation surface.

    More specifically, we represent the correlation surface by the set edges it spans in the ZX graph.
    Each edge establishes a correlation between the logical operators at the two ends of the edge. For
    example, an edge connecting two Z nodes represents the correlation between the logical Z operators
    at the two nodes. There is also a special kind of correlation surface that has no interior edges but
    represented by a single node. It can be seen as applying spider fusion rule to a single edge ZX graph,
    which results in a correlation surface totally compressed in a single node.

    Additionally, the input/output logical operators at the boundary of the correlation surface are
    represented as a mapping from the the input/output labels to the logical operator type there.

    Attributes:
        nodes: A set of ``ZXNode`` representing the logical operators appeared in the correlation surface.
            For example, if either a logical X operator or Z operator has appeared at this node position in
            the span, then the node is of X or Z kind. If both X and Z logical operators have appeared at
            this node position in the span, then the node is of Y kind.
        span: A set of ``ZXEdge`` representing the span of the correlation surface.
        external_stabilizer: A mapping from the port label to the logical operator at the port. Sign of the
            stabilizer is neglected. If the correlation surface is closed, i.e. the stabilizer is terminated
            with the initialization or measurements, the mapping is empty.

    :py:class:`~tqec.computation.correlation.CorrelationSurface` in a ZX graph.

    Starting from each leaf node in the graph, the function explores how can the X/Z logical observable
    move through the graph to form a correlation surface:

    - For a X/Z kind leaf node, it can only support the logical observable with the opposite type. Only
      a single type of logical observable is explored from the leaf node.
    - For a Y kind leaf node, it can only support the Y logical observable, i.e. the presence of
      both X and Z logical observable. Both X and Z type logical observable are explored from the leaf node.
      And the two correlation surfaces are combined to form the Y type correlation surface.
    - For the port node, it can support any type of logical observable. Both X and Z type logical observable
      are explored from the port node.

    The function uses a flood fill like recursive algorithm to find the correlation surface in the graph.
    Firstly, we define two types of nodes in the graph:

    - *broadcast node:* A node that has seen logical observable with basis opposite to its own basis.
      A logical observable needs to be broadcasted to all the neighbors of the node.
    - *passthrough node:* A node that has seen logical observable with the same basis as its own basis.
      A logical observable needs to be only supported on an even number of edges connected to the node.

    The algorithm starts from a set of frontier nodes and greedily expands the correlation
    surface until no more broadcast nodes are in the frontier. Then it explore the
    passthrough nodes, and select even number of edges to be included in the surface. If
    no such selection can be made, the search is pruned. For different choices, the algorithm
    recursively explores the next frontier until the search is completed. Finally, the branches
    at different nodes are produced to form the correlation surface.
