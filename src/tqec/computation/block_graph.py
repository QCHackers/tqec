    A block graph consists of building blocks that fully define the boundary
    conditions and topological structures of a logical computation. It corresponds
    to the commonly used 3D spacetime diagram representation of a surface code
    logical computation.

    The graph contains two categories of blocks:

    1. :py:class:`~tqec.computation.cube.Cube`: The fundamental building blocks
    of the computation. A cube represents a block of quantum operations within
    a specific spacetime volume. These operations preserve or manipulate the
    quantum information encoded in the logical qubits. Cubes are represented
    as nodes in the graph.

    2. :py:class:`~tqec.computation.pipe.Pipe`: Connects cubes to form the
    topological structure representing the logical computation. A pipe occupies
    no spacetime volume and only replaces the operations within the cubes it
    connects. Pipes are represented as edges in the graph.
