        This class stores qubits in the plaquette local coordinate system and a scheduled
        circuit that should be applied on those qubits to perform the QEC experiment.

        By convention, the local plaquette coordinate system is composed of a X-axis pointing
        to the right and a Y-axis pointing down.

        Args:
            qubits: qubits used by the plaquette circuit, given in the local
                plaquette coordinate system.
            circuit: scheduled quantum circuit implementing the computation that
                the plaquette should represent.
