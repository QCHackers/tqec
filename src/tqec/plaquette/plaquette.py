    """Represents a QEC plaquette.

    This class stores qubits in the plaquette local coordinate system and a
    scheduled circuit that should be applied on those qubits to perform the
    QEC experiment.

    By convention, the local plaquette coordinate system is composed of a
    X-axis pointing to the right and a Y-axis pointing down.

    Attributes:
        name: a unique name for the plaquette. This field is used to compare
            plaquettes efficiently (two :class:`Plaquette` instances are
            considered equal if and only if their names are the same) as well as
            computing a hash value for any plaquette instance. Finally, the name
            is used to represent a :class:`Plaquette` instance as a string.
        qubits: qubits used by the plaquette circuit, given in the local
            plaquette coordinate system.
        circuit: scheduled quantum circuit implementing the computation that
            the plaquette should represent.
        mergeable_instructions: a set of instructions that can
            be merged. This is useful when merging several plaquettes'
            circuits together to remove duplicate instructions.

    Raises:
        TQECException: if the provided `circuit` uses qubits not listed in
            `qubits`.
