"""Defines several scalable arrays of numbers used to tile plaquettes.

This module defines the :py:class:`~tqec.templates.base.Template` interface that
should be implemented by subclasses implementing different templates.

Terminology used
================

The "template" terminology is used to describe an object (instance of a subclass
of the :py:class:`~tqec.templates.base.Template` class) that can be
"instantiated" into an array of integers from an input integer scaling parameter
:math:`k`.

A subtemplate is a constant-size sub-array of a template instantiation. For the
moment, a subtemplate is always a square sub-array of odd-sized sides.

The scaling parameter :math:`k` directly relates to the code distance :math:`d`
(at least for regular surface code) where :math:`d = 2 k + 1`.

Templates
=========

As noted in the terminology section, a "template" is defined as something that
can be "instantiated", i.e., that can generate an array of integer from a given
scaling parameter :math:`k`.

Templates should all inherit from the base :py:class:`~tqec.templates.base.Template`
class that defines a few abstract methods that have to be overridden by child
classes. The most canonical example of a template is implemented by the
:py:class:`~tqec.templates.qubit.QubitTemplate` class: it represents the
arrangement of plaquettes needed to make a logical qubit.

The following code demonstrates quite well what a template is supposed to be.

.. code-block:: python

    from tqec.templates.display import display_template
    from tqec.templates.qubit import QubitTemplate

    template = QubitTemplate()
    display_template(template, 2)

It outputs

.. code-block:: text

    1   5   6   5   6   2
    7   9   10  9   10  11
    8   10  9   10  9   12
    7   9   10  9   10  11
    8   10  9   10  9   12
    3   13  14  13  14  4

The template instantiation is an array of size :math:`6 \\times 6`, filled with
integers. Each unique integer will eventually either be linked to a plaquette or
be left empty. Let's try to clean up a little bit the array by setting the
values ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, ``4``, ``5``, ``8``, ``12`` and ``14`` to the value
``0`` that means "no plaquette here" for all templates (and that is represented
by ``.`` for visibility).

.. code-block:: python

    k = 2
    removed_plaquettes = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 14}
    display_template(
        template, k, [i if i not in removed_plaquettes else 0 for i in range(1, 15)]
    )

that outputs

.. code-block:: text

    .   .   6   .   6   .
    7   9   10  9   10  11
    .   10  9   10  9   .
    7   9   10  9   10  11
    .   10  9   10  9   .
    .   13  .   13  .   .

The above array looks very much like a logical qubit arrangement as can be seen in
most of the papers using the surface code and below!

But that is only a distance
:math:`5 = 2 \\times 2 + 1 = 2 k + 1` code. Let's try to scale that up:

.. code-block:: python

    k = 5
    display_template(
        template, k, [i if i not in removed_plaquettes else 0 for i in range(1, 15)]
    )

outputs what we would expect: the "template" of plaquettes for a logical qubit
using a distance :math:`d = 2 k + 1 = 2 \\times 5 + 1 = 11` code:

.. code-block:: text

    .   .   6   .   6   .   6   .   6   .   6   .
    7   9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  11
    .   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   .
    7   9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  11
    .   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   .
    7   9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  11
    .   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   .
    7   9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  11
    .   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   .
    7   9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  11
    .   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   10  9   .
    .   13  .   13  .   13  .   13  .   13  .   .

This ability to scale to arbitrarily large values of :math:`k` (as long as your
computed can store a matrix of shape :math:`(2k+1, 2k+1)`) is exactly the reason
of existence of the :py:class:`~tqec.templates.base.Template` class.

This module also includes a few sub-classes implementing the
:py:class:`~tqec.templates.base.Template` interface:

1. :py:class:`~tqec.templates.qubit.QubitTemplate` that has already been used in
   documentation and that represents a logical qubit.
2. :py:class:`~tqec.templates.qubit.Qubit4WayJunctionTemplate` that represents a
   logical qubit that has 4 junctions in space and is still a work in progress.
3. :py:class:`~tqec.templates.layout.LayoutTemplate` that represent an arbitrary
   layout of other templates arranged on a regular grid.

Sub-templates
=============

This module also implements helpers to list and represent sub-templates. A
sub-template is basically a sub-array of a given template instantiation.
Sub-templates are all of known constant size and cannot be scaled. Sub-templates
are represented as an array of integers with a square shape (i.e., 2-dimensional
with the same number of elements in each dimension) of odd0sized sides.

The module :py:mod:`tqec.templates.subtemplates` provides functions to compute
all the subtemplates for given template instantiation and subtemplate size along
with some data-structure to represent efficiently this collection of
sub-templates.

Displaying
==========

Templates are basically scalable arrays of integers. The module
:py:mod:`tqec.templates.display` provides a few functions to display a pretty and
human readable representation of a given template instantiation. These functions
are used in the documentation about templates above, and so their output can be
observed above.
